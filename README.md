# website-blocker
There are many other activities to do on the internet, social media included. 
Social media is a huge distraction in schools and throughout the school day. ... The internet has many distractions that can prevent work form getting done :-( 
So I tried making a website blocker which will block those websites during my study time and once that period is over I'll be free to access them again!! 

### How can I use?

1. Simply fork and run the web_blocker.py file on cmd.
2. We can also schedule this by using Task Scheduler so that whenever we start our system it will run in background. (here the file extension should be .pyw )
